This program implements a concept of artificial intelligence, called Genetic Algorithm.
It is a kind of randomized algorithm.

The program tries to generate a specified word(or a sentence) such as "Hello World"
from scratch. The program creates multiple random char sequences and tries to match it with required phrase.
On repeated selection, cross over and mutation, after many generation the sentence is generated.
