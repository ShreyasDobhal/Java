Machine Learning
================
This program implements a concept of artificial intelligence, called Machine Learning.
Which is generally used for regression and classification.
But here machine learning is used to train an agent to play Cross n Zero (Tic Tac Toe)
with the user.
The program tries random moves or recalls the moves which it has played earlier.
It learns from its experience, its lose and wins.
The more training it is given, the better it becomes.
